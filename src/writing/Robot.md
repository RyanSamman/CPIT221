We had difficulties with the make me buy task, mainly because most of us haven't even begun!

You might ask, why haven't I begun? Personally,  since the beginning of October I have been preoccupied with studying for the mid-term exams. You can see this reflected in the quality of the weekly writings I've written. While most people have become better at the writing, my writing has become worse! While I used to spend hours doing my weekly writing, I no longer have the time to write to that standard.

We just finished our exams, and due to that, we have a backlog of assignments and tasks.

- We're trying to create a good schedule for the coming term.
- Everyone is trying to catch up with things we've taken while doing the mid-term exams.
- I have a statistics assignment due today, which came out of nowhere. 
- The deadline of a massive programming assignment is soon.
- This weekly writing is also a task which we need to finish, to begin doing the make me buy task.
- We need to plan out and discuss the group project.

And along with all that, we have the 'make me buy task'. As you can see, we're a bit preoccupied with other things, so we haven't had time to focus on the make me buy task.  While I have planned out the idea and things I will be doing in the task, I still need to refine, record, and edit them. Thankfully, It's the next thing on my backlog of things to do, so I hope I will be doing it soon!
