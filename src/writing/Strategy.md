## TASK BASED LEARNING

**Having knowledge of a topic means nothing if you cannot apply it in practice,** which is important in a work environment. Soft Skills are notoriously difficult to teach and learn, and progressing on them with practical tasks is much more efficient than otherwise. That's why I like the teaching style of CPIT221, as it's entirely Task-Based. Therefore, when students do eventually enter the workforce, they are prepared to overcome any challenges they may face.

## TEACHING STRATEGY

Ironically, the 'Lectures' themselves doesn't play much of a role in this course. **The actual teachers are the individual students,** who are teaching themselves while doing the tasks!

For example, there was nothing in the course explicitly teaching how to use a camera, or how to edit a video. However, that's exactly what most students did while doing the Make Me Buy video. While some people were left in the dust, those who had passion in their work took the initiative to develop their skills.

## STUDENT OUTCOMES

Regarding the visualization of the Student Objectives, I think the metaphor was nicely done.

The tasks act as the seeds for our knowledge, and with the right care and support, grows our skills into what was envisioned by the professors. By the end of the course, I'm confident that I would be able to meet and exceed all the student outcomes, and apply them in a practical setting.
