Although our civilization was built on teamwork and collaboration, these days people seem to prefer working alone. Our school curricula could be to blame, which focus more on cramming as much information as they can into people's minds, instead of practical skills and collaborative work.


In school, I always created groups to study together, and work as a team to cover our weaknesses. While I was pretty bad in the earlier years of school, studying as a group lead me to obtain better study habits, and I eventually overcame most of my weaknesses. Studying as a team in the Foundation Year of University also provided similar results, and I was able to get good grades in a minimal amount of time. In the extra time I had, I was able to practice on programming and reach the level I am at today.


While our teamwork for graded materials may not seem great, teamwork is still prevalent throughout our lives. Some people play sports, others play games, but a vast majority of people are still performing "Teamwork" even if they don't realize it.


**So why are we bad at working as a team in university or school?** That's because that level of teamwork is not achieved in a few hours of doing an activity, but is accumulated over countless years of experience! While students might not be great at working together now, with enough practice and dedication, I believe anyone is able to gain these skills and become better at working collaboratively.
