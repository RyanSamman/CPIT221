## Week 3

In our third week of Technical Communications, we took a look some at ways of writing and structuring sentences. Compared to previous weeks, this week focused mostly on theoretical aspects of communication.

Although I preferred the more practical - and innovative - teaching style of the first two weeks; I do think that the topics covered are essential to be able to improve as an effective communicator. 


## Communication's Role at Work

In most jobs, good communication between co-workers is essential in keeping things running smoothly, and making sure everyone's goals and visions are aligned.

Since our field is more technical in nature, we tend to focus solely on our technical skills; Which we tend to think is the key factor to success in our career.

Therefore it is easy to forget about skills involving interaction with others - via oral or written channels - which tend to play a more significant role on our performance.


## The Most Important Means of Communication

Ever had an important task or assignment? Chances are that it has been sent to you via a written communication channel. Whether you agree or not, written communication is definitely among the most important skills a professional can have. Therefore I think it's great that this course is pushing us to be more aware of the limitations of written communication skills, and enable us to be developing them in a more practical style.

In my opinion, the most important point covered this week is to avoid using jargon, and to be clearer when you write. Many technical people tend to speak jargon unintentionally; Which hinders the effectiveness of communication with others.

As our field is quite technical in nature - with lots to learn - you constantly face people with different levels of knowledge.  Therefore it is important to always keep your language as simple as possible, and explain any unclear terms.

## Note on Draft #1

As you can see - both drafts contain the same idea - yet are presented differently. When a reader sees massive blocks of text, small font, and grammatical errors; People lose interest in your writing.

Furthermore, following a visual hierarchy will help the reader find the most important parts of your writing.
