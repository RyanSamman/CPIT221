As the self-proclaimed leader of our group, I noticed quite a bit while doing our group conversation, which I can split into 3 parts:

- **My Own Actions** (Leadership)
- **Forming a Team**
- **People's Vision of a Project**

Which in my opinion, all play essential parts in a project.

## MY PERFORMANCE

**Many people are quick to blame others when things don't go their way.** However I think that it is more important to **reflect on yourself first,** as that is the only thing that is fully in your control.

In the beginning, I had contacted all my teammates, created a group to organize our thoughts, and attempted to agree on a date for the conversation. We had minor disagreements with the platform we would be using to hold the meeting, but I had resolved it quickly. Then to test out the platform and recording, I had created a short video explaining our task and the steps we need to take to successfully achieve our goals.

So far so good, right? **However, I neglected to get feedback from my teammates**; This lead us into doing the meeting one day before the deadline, and we barely finished the group blog before it was due.

While managing our group, I did two major mistakes:

- **First, I should have been more persistent in scheduling a meeting date,** as nobody was interested in getting things done until near or at the deadline.
- **Second, I didn't communicate effectively with my teammates,** who did not expect to write anything until the day of the deadline, which is reflected in the quality of our blog.
While we did finish the task on time, I wasn't totally satisfied with the quality of our work. However, I did learn a lot on working along with other people, and I'm sure I would do better if I were facing the same situation in the future.

## TEAMMATES

**Forming a team is like putting together pieces of a puzzle.** In the real world, a significant amount of money is spent in the recruiting process. In some cases, thousands of CVs1 are looked at; Of which, a small portion go through an interview process, assessing their skills, and fit for the team, for only a select few to be hired. 

However, when our teams are selected randomly, we don't know anything about anyone's skills and motivations, making it hard to get everyone's goals aligned and get things done in a timely manner. While I do like the concept and experience of being in a team selected at random, it took an entire week to organize everyone to do a 5 minute conversation. Therefore, I would prefer the ability to form my own team if the project was time sensitive, had long term consequences, or had a scale of any significance.


VISION

I don't think any specific person can inherently be called "bad". **However, one's vision of a project plays a major factor in their quality of work.**

While it is a leader's job to have a clear vision and motivate their teammates, there is only so much they can do. If someone isn't convinced that a certain task is worthwhile, they wouldn't be motivated to putting all their effort into it. This is what likely happened in most groups; People simply didn't see the point in the group conversation, leading them into neglecting it, preferring to do more productive things with their time.
