## Ryan Samman and Mohammed Baswaid - Improving CPIT-110

As CPIT-110 is the first course which exposes students to programming and the world of computing, it would be the most influential factor in how students perceive FCIT. Therefore, some emphasis on real world use cases for programming would go a long way into improving student's perception of FCIT.

Some things that students could be shown are:

- **Working with files**, Such as text and Comma Seperated Value (CSV) files
- **Analyzing data**, and possibly performing some statistics on it
- **Displaying Graphs**, below is an example of a Matplotlib chart:

What we studied in python was only writing math programs, so we need more information on things that can help us in the future. If we show the students how to do these things, it would be better.

## Mohammad Salem and Abdulqader - Opportunities with Programming

Now, many companies need to have a digital platform that needs to be processed and protected. This can be done by FCIT graduated students. In addition, graduated students can have their own business like in IT, and Cyber Security.


Nowadays, and I suspect in the future, there will be more hackers and they will try to hack everybody’s information. Cyber Security workers they could protect their data from hackers and prevent anything from happening. Also people with this knowledge could open a company, we don’t need to have a building or anything, and just work online from home.



## Sultan - Awareness

We could open a student social media account to talk and post videos about the experiences we have had on the faculty of computing and information technology. This will give experience to other students in high school or preparatory year students of FCIT.

We have also created a prototype of a student database to help students find others with the same interests, since we cannot see others face to face in with the current  coronavirus situation. In the future, we could create a website to display that data, and also list the projects ongoing in KAU.

## Mohammed Baswaid - Conclusion
To sum everything up, we agreed these 3 points are going to help our goal: 

- They could improve CPIT110
- The work opportunity after graduation
- More awareness
