## NETWORKING

Since High School, I've heard time and time again that **networking is the most important part of university.** Since then, I've internalized the concept, and applied it in my Foundation Year at King Abdulaziz University. I always went out of my way to meet new people, and as a result, I've met quite a few people who ended up entering Engineering, Medicine, and most importantly, the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology.

Furthermore, since the start of my year in the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, I've become more active on Twitter thanks to the CPIT221 course, [and started posting some of my projects through that medium.](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_) Through Twitter, I've attracted the attention of many of my fellow students and several senior IT and CS students, and learn more through them.

## WHY ARE NETWORKS IMPORTANT

Although I've created a network for myself, you might be asking, how is this useful?

To excel in an area, you need to be surrounded by like-minded people who share the same goals. Forming a good network allows you to be guided by people further down the road than you are, and allows you to stay motivated and focused towards your end goal. Most of what I know so far has been entirely from the people I have met, and the advice they have given me. This is why it seems like I learn extremely fast, I always have a clear goal and objective to work towards, supported by a well-defined path to follow.

## FORMING A TEAM

If it wasn't obvious, I would also be able to select people from my network to form a team for group projects, such as this one. As I already study and converse with many of these people on a daily basis, the barriers of communication would be limited. Therefore, you can say that I've been preparing for this moment since I've entered University!

After selecting my teammates, we would hold a brainstorming session to come up with ideas, select the one which fits the task best, and develop the idea further. Afterwards, we would agree among ourselves on which roles to take, and split the work evenly among us. Ideally, we would try finishing our project well before the deadline, so we would have ample time to identify any major mistakes, and fix them. Then, it'll hopefully be smooth sailing until we reach our end goal!
