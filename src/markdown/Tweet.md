<h1>Suprise on the First Day</h1>
</center>

In the first task, the professor was just introducing us to the course, when suddenly, **we were asked to make a tweet on the spot!** Many of us did not even have a twitter account, and personally, I was very nervous to post a tweet with my face in it!

For my first tweet, I decided the best way to stand out was to use a program that converted Text To Speech, instead of speaking myself. [Find out how to do that here, along with a JavaScript Version!](/tts)

After the task, I started posting more than just CPIT221 tasks on my twitter, and started posting some of my programming projects!

Fast Forward to the end of the year, [my Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_) has allowed me to meet a lot of great people, such as [Khaled](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_/status/1331155792368709632), [Abdulrahman](https://twitter.com/Abdulr_ghazi), [Zeyad](https://twitter.com/CallMeZeyad), [Sultan](https://twitter.com/Sul6anBH), and even students from upper years of FCIT!
