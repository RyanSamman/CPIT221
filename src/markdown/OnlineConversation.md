<center><h1>Online Conversation</h1></center>

In this task, **we were required to meet up and coordinate with 4 other students, selected at random.** 

As to be expected, [the result was not ideal](/writing/online-conversation-blog), and we had major issues communicating. However, the task was not all for naught, as I benefited immensely from this task! Ironically, While I got comfortable speaking to strangers, it was not due to the task directly, but the side effects of doing the task!

### Student Database

[As I had mentioned on our blog](/writing/online-conversation-blog), I wanted to create a *student database*, however, the execution was not ideal. Not wanting to deal with user authentication or a backend, I decided to use Google Forms. However, the responses would be stored in Google Sheets, [and looking at their API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api), I realized it would be a massive headache to parse the data and display it on a website. 

However, the biggest nail in the coffin was when I realized that I would be putting people's personal information online, and most people weren't in favor of that. Furthermore, my design skills weren't up to par, and wouldn't inspire anyone to ultimately use the website!

Therefore, I decided to put this idea away for a later date, but I may revisit it when I have the proper time and team to pull it off!

### Aftermath


Afterwards, we were requested to [write about our experience with the task in one of our weekly writings](http://localhost:3000/writing/networking). I had a lot to say about my teammates, but those factors are out of my control, **and the only thing I can hope to change is myself.**

After the task, [I decided to analyze people's opinions on the task](/writing), which is what prompted me to make the Word Cloud below!

I believe the main point of this task was just an excuse to make people go out of their comfort zone, and talk to people they haven't met before. I would say I am largely an introvert, and **a main point people have against this course is that it *prefers extroverts*.** However, if you do not go out of your comfort zone, the harsh reality is that you will not be equipped the skills you need to be effective in the future!


After making the Word Cloud, I decided to go out of my comfort zone, and E-Mail Dr. Rayed about what I created, and see what his opinions were!

Some Foreshadowing on what happened next. [I talk more about it here!](/writing/#word-cloud)

Not only did I show it to Dr. Rayed, but I have also shown it to the whole CPIT221 group! The reactions were mixed, some were shocked, some were angry, and some were inspired!

Those who were inspired naturally wanted to speak to me, and it [caused me to meet a bunch of people who I eventually created the proposal with](/proposal/ours). More importantly, it established my reputation within FCIT20!

However, I did not stop with FCIT20! With my newfound confidence speaking to people I haven't met before, I started to broaden my horizons, and attempt to speak to the upper year students in FCIT as well!
