Finally finishing the proposal, I have never slept happier. However, that happiness didn't last, as I woke up realizing that **I had made a last minute change**, ruining the indentation of the introductory page! This is why it is never a good idea to perform breaking changes at the last second!

While I wasn't entirely happy with the final result of the presentation and proposal, I believe we did the best we could within our time constraints. I have identified three key mistakes I did this task, which I will hopefully not repeat!

- **Trust**. In the beginning, I had **too much trust in my teammates**, and did not assign discrete roles and tasks for everyone to perform. This is the exact same mistake I made in the [online conversation](/writing/online-conversation). While I preferred to give everyone the freedom to do as they liked, it wasted a significant amount of time. However, nearing the end of the proposal, I had **too little trust in my teammates**. Before we recorded the presentation, I mentioned that I may do the presentation on my own if it didn't meet my standards. Looking back, I regret saying those words, and the final presentation ended up being much better than I expected.

- **References**. Overall, I feel like our references were not strong enough to back up the changes we have proposed. If I were in the Dean or Coordinator's place, I would be expecting thorough research into the pros and cons of each point before I would be comfortable implementing real changes.

- **Audio Quality**. My audio quality wasn't great throughout the presentation, and I have been struggling with audio in my videos for a while. I recently bought a new , and will not be making this mistake in the future!

To this day, our discussion channels for the task remain on our discord. This is to serve as a reminder of our teamwork for this proposal, and a hallmark for our future teamwork together.
