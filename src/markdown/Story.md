## INTRODUCTION

Since Dr. Buhari has shared his story, I decided to share my story as well, along with some role models I have had on the way.

I bring you back to the early years of high school. Since my early days of school, **I have never been good at anything**.  Like Dr. Buhari, I did the A-Levels, which is debatably the hardest curriculum in the world. **To prepare myself for the exams, I decided to create a group with my friends to focus on studying.** While I was struggling at first, over the years I became better and better. How was I becoming better, you might ask? By using the Feynman Technique!

**The idea of the Feynman Technique is to explain a concept, in its simplest form, so that someone else can understand that same concept.** Through that, you would also be reinforcing your knowledge of that concept.

Back to the point, by creating that initial group and discussing how to solve complex problems together, I 'discovered' a way of studying similar to the Feynman Technique on, which I only found out existed while reading about the famous Physicist,** Richard Feynman.** Over a few years of applying my version of the Feynman Technique, I was able to develop my thinking and studying skills, overcame several major hurdles, and me and my friends progressed far more than just 'slightly above average'. 

However, grades weren't everything. While I have done well considering solely my grades, my other skills were lacking. Specifically, **my programming and communication skills**, which have caused me to lose quite a few opportunities.

If it wasn't obvious by my twitter posts, I overcame the early stages of acquiring programming skills by the time I finished my foundation year, namely due to **Ahmed Al Taib**'s brilliant introduction to the fundamentals of Python. **While I have always wanted to learn how to program for years, CPIT110 was the course that finally pushed me to do it.** It's clear to me that he and his team has put a large amount of thought and effort into developing the course, especially after researching for weeks on ideas to improve CPCS202. I would like him to be proud knowing that his course has been effective, and put students in the track to become programmers such as myself. 

In the span of a few weeks, I was able to finish most of what CPIT110 had to offer, so I had to go beyond the course. Fast-forward a few months, reading several books, and doing several more (free) courses from Harvard, The University of Helsinki, and MIT, I developed many of the skills I have today. In the summer, I was even able to lead my own small open source project. My teammates, a Frontend Engineer and a Web Designer who both had a decade more experience than me, were impressed at how I explained the technical details of the backend system, and how easily it integrated with their code. While progress on our project has slowed to a halt since my first term at FCIT began, I realized how important clear communication was to a software project. Therefore, I was very excited to be developing my communication skills further with the CPIT221 course.

However, I apologize to Ahmed Al Taib, as he sits in 2nd place in my array of role models. And that is because the 0th and 1st places go to Dr. Buhari and Dr. Rayed!

Just as CPIT110 was the push I needed to start developing my programming skills, CPIT221 has done the same for my Communication Skills. As you can see from many of my friends from my foundation year:

Many agree that I was horrible at communicating. **I was a very shy person, had a horrible stutter, <center>

</center>and I wasn't confident in myself**. However, due to Dr. Buhari and Dr. Rayed's efforts in the CP

IT221 course, I have advanced my communication skills greatly across several fronts.

## ORAL & VISUAL COMMUNICATION

As you can see from my first video, it wasn't that great. In fact, I even made the video private afterwards, out of embarrassment.

After that first video, I spent possibly hundreds of hours making YouTube videos on the subjects I've taken in FCIT to develop my oral communication, as I was more used to explaining with text from my group in High School. While the video and sound quality itself was horrible, the goal was mainly to practice speaking, without stuttering.

Then, I was introduced to the Make Me Buy task, where I learned how to use a camera and edit videos.

While the videos still aren't great, I have identified exactly where the videos fall short, and I will take account of them the next time I record a video. I nearly finished several scripts for videos on skills programmers need before even starting programming, such as Git & GitHub, IDEs, and <center>

rkdown, all I have left to do is record it! 

## WRITTEN COMMUNICATION

In the beginning of the course, I decided it would be fun to spend 10 hours on the weekly journals, just to see how the quality would turn out. [The result was also an improvement in my GitHub documentation!](https://github.com/RyanSamman/BlogWordCloud)

The weekly writing tasks have also allowed me to create one of my favorite writings yet!

However, that pace was impossible to keep up, especially when the exams started. While my writing suffered, it wasn't for nothing, as I aced many of my exams! Sadly, that also lead to my worst writing yet, and a major writing block for nearly a month.

Furthermore, I would like to apologize in advance for the quality of my future weekly writing tasks. With the midterm exam and final exams being 10 days apart, this will likely be my last journal that <center>

would consider being up to my standards.

## GROUP WORK

For me, my group work wasn't simply to get grades for the course, but to get closer to the new people I have met. I think my goal was a success, and I believe we nearly became a 'high-performing team'. With the skills I developed in my summer group project, we were able to clearly organize our goals:

However, for the proposal, a normal proposal wouldn't be enough, as there wouldn't be much at stake. Therefore, our goal was to write a proposal and presentation of the quality at which I would be proud to send to the dean of FCIT! Whether my proposal will be successful is a different matter, but <center>

## CONCLUSION

What I love the most about the course is that the majority of the learning is not from the lecture or course itself, but from the student's efforts while completing the tasks. While it's amazing that I've developed several ways of communicating, I was surprised to learn that **not only has my written and verbal communication improved, but my entire mindset of communication has changed!** I would also like the chairman of IT to rest assured, if he were to suggest reintroducing exams again, that he would receive far more than 6 angry E-mails this time! It is very inspirational seeing Dr. Buhari and Dr. Rayed being such close friends with each other, and I hope to become friends with someone at that level in the future.

Due to my newfound communication skills, I have attracted many of the best students in the faculty through twitter. We are now creating a community of first year FCIT students who are interested in Computer Science and Programming. Similar to how I first started out in High School, we hope to tackle the hardest of challenges in faculty together.
