Before the task was announced, we were asked to make a weekly writing on how we would form a team.[As I had set out in my weekly writing](http://localhost:3000/writing/networking), I had formed a great team of promising individuals to aid me in the proposal.

However, instead of working with people I had known since our foundation year, I decided to give the people I had recently met in FCIT a chance. Therefore, I chose [Khalid](https://twitter.com/KhaledMAlasmari), [Faisel](https://twitter.com/Eni2Mn8FlBFBzHf), [Amin](https://twitter.com/_Amin_Ali_), and [Zeyad](https://twitter.com/CallMeZeyad) to be my teammates.

We immediately started planning what we would be doing, as the task was announced. Our initial idea was to Integrate CPIT201 and CPCS202 together, teaching the theory of programming in CPIT201, and applying the concepts in CPCS202. However, we immediately realized that the plan would be too ambitious, as our biggest point was to teach students Assembly. Therefore, we scrapped most of the ideas.

After some more discussion, we decided to focusing on improving CPCS202, and we threw around several ideas together. However, as an extra challenge, we decided that we would be addressing our proposal to the Dean of FCIT, to ensure we work as hard as we could. 

After the brainstorming phase, I created a Trello board, and put all our ideas neatly in one place, as you can see below!

After the core ideas were done, we all came together on discord, and [created a survey to get a better idea on what the students did and did not like.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eT6cWlfSMaBb3oK7geN-mo9q7Jvfm1fUq0ZaRsOXCGI/viewform?edit_requested=true)

Afterwards, I wrote some code to clean up the data, and generate charts for each question. However, I have never done something like this before! While my teammates were making progress on the proposal and ideas, I felt unproductive trying to generate these charts. To my surprise, I was able to get everything working right as I was about to give up!

After we were able to get a clearer picture of what we were up against with the charts, we split the work across the 6 of us.

But wait, us 6? Aren't we supposed to be 5 people? Right after we began, I met [Ahmed Al Abass](https://twitter.com/Ahmad_A_Dev), and he was struggling to find a group who cared about the work they were doing. Somehow, he convinced Dr Rayed to add him to our team, and that is how we ended up with 6 people overall! It ended up being a good call, as Ahmed ended up being critical to laying the groundwork for the proposal, and asked great questions while we did the presentation. Furthermore, it turns out that we have similar interests with Software Engineering, and I will likely be working close to him in the future!

My other teammates were responsible for researching more about the professors and the Dean, refining our ideas, and finding a template for our presentation. [We even found the Dean's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/iakyp2/videos), where he has posted several interesting and informative videos. This video in particular resonated with me, and he talks about many important topics related to increasing your chances of getting hired.

A major problem I see with many students is that they go through university or a course, but they aren't able to effectively use the things they have learned afterwards! Personally, I always apply the knowledge have learned in a project, or ensure I have a deep understanding of what I have learned, such as:

- [Learning Assembly for CPIT201](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_/status/1315224814974455809)
- Unit Testing & Redirecting System I/O to aid in solving repetitive CPCS202 assignments 
- [Deriving STAT210 Equations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prhcIfLBSiM)
- [Making an Expression Parser / Simple Language after a CS course from MIT](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_/status/1317901736103862276)
- [Training a GPT-2 model after an introductory ML course from HPCC](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_/status/1331566216784318467)
- [Making my own Blog after CPIT221](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_/status/1335155439122718726)

However, the majority of the courses from FCIT focus on memorization, rather than a strong understanding of the subject at hand. This may be a reason why employers are starting to realize the value of a degree has withered away, as it is now easier than ever to learn a skill on your own.
 
The simplest course to shift away from **memorization** to **comprehension** would be the programming courses, and is why we have chosen CPCS202 for the proposal! Over the next few years, I will be applying this concept to nearly all the courses myself, ensuring I have a thorough understanding of what I learn.

Back to the story, My teammates did their roles perfectly, and we even finished a basic prototype for the proposal a week before the deadline! However, things went downhill from there...

Out of nowhere, all but one of my teammates were required to write two 2000 word reports on Operating Systems and Networks, due extremely soon! To add oil to the fire, one of my team-members caught Corona, and were taken out of the picture.

While I don't like being in a leadership position, my teammates forced the role onto me. **While most people are excited to be assigned as a leader, they tend to not see the responsibilities that come alongside it!** I had to make a choice, to let my teammates focus on their report, or the proposal. 

Therefore, I chose to let my teammates focus on their report, while me and Ahmed worked on the proposal. Thanks to the initial prototype of the proposal everyone created, and the ideas already present on Trello, I was able to smoothly put everything together for our presentation. 

For our presentation, we decided that we did not want it to sound like we are just lazily reading from a script. Therefore we attempted at a more conversational style, where everyone just said what they had in mind. However, this was quite hard to pull off, and we needed to rehearse it several times. This was the final result!

However, time was running out, and on the day the proposal was supposed to be due, I realized that I hadn't finished my weekly writing! While I initially planned on quickly finishing the weekly writing, [just as I did the previous week](/writing/robot), my ideas happened to line up perfectly together, and I ended up spending the entire day writing it. Thinking about Dr. Buhari's story reminded me of my story, so I decided to go off-topic, and [write about my own story](/writing/story)! I hoped that Dr. Rayed would be distracted from my writing, and forget that the deadline for the proposal was on the same day.

Afterwards, I realized that the Weekly Writing was due on Saturday, not Friday, and that I had wasted time I could have spent on the proposal! However, [with Dr. Rayed tweeting about my weekly writing](https://twitter.com/rayed1420/status/1327417806917410818), I couldn't waste any more time, and got back to work!
