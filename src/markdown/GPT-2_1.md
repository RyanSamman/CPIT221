For the Values task, I had a feeling that I wanted to do something interesting with the images! While I had scraped [text](https://github.com/RyanSamman/BlogWordCloud) and [images](https://github.com/RyanSamman/RedditImageScraper) before, I had never scraped text from an image! Set out to completing my new idea, I attempted to experiment with OCR libraries, scraping the text from my own post!
