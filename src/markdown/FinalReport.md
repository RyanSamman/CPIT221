# Final Report

After finishing the reports for CPIT201, I was not in the mood to write a third!

While other students play games or watch videos to relax, I like programming. I started the habit when I first took CPIT110, and a year in, the progress I have made has really started to show!

In one of my programming sessions, Dr Rayed just uploaded the grades for the CPIT221 Proposal, and I decided to visualize that data! However, matplotlib started to become stale to me, and I decided to try out more interactive means of displaying data, on a website!

Using a website allowed me to use more graphics and embedding than otherwise, and allowed me to link multiple things together in an interactive way.

However, a few days in, I realized I could go further than just displaying data, and work on both my frontend skills and my report!

Through the component-based design of React, I was able to quickly put together this website, and show Dr Rayed. Thankfully, he was on the same page as me, and gave me the permission to work on this website instead. While creating this website, I realized I had everything I needed to create my own blog.

I still consider myself to be more of a backend person than a frontend, however, I'm now confident I would be able to guide and work with people who are interested in frontend development.
