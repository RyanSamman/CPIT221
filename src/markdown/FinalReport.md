<center><h1>Final Report</h1></center>

After finishing CPIT201's reports, **I was not in the mood to be writing another boring report!**

While other students play games or watch videos to relax, I program something interesting! When I first began CPIT110, I established this habit, and my efforts are now bearing fruit!

I was thinking of something interesting to do, when Dr. Rayed had just happened to upload the Proposal grades! I immediately realized that I wanted to do something with the data. However, I was bored of Matplotlib, and **I wanted to try out other mediums for data visualization, such as on a website!**

You can see the visualized data in the [Proposal tab](#top), and I go over the [Course Chosen](/proposal/chosen), [individual group grades](/proposal/grades), and a [high level overview of how groups performed against the rubric](/proposal/rubric).
