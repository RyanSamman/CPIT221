# Issues

As this is only the second semester the course has been taught in this way, I noticed a few issues. However, these issues may just be what I have faced, and not what other students may feel.

### Course Materials
**Some of the course materials are immensely useful,** but the students have no opportunity to practice the things they have learned in the course. However, grading such materials is hard and time-consuming, and it is best to leave practising the concepts to the student's digression.

**Some sections were not as useful,** such as the grammar sections. The majority of students have already taken four English courses. Alongside that, the weekly writing and reports are likely sufficient to drill in grammar rules. While good grammar is important, these days we have tools to automatically check and correct our writing for us. In fact, I used one of those tools to proofread this website! 

### Feedback

The tasks were graded along a rubric, which is a good way to standardize the grading process, and give the students a precise guide on how they should be proceeding with the task. However, there were times where I felt like I wanted more critical feedback in what I could improve, such as [our proposal](/proposal/ours) and CV. [Critical feedback helps students remember their mistakes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317724884_The_impact_of_critical_feedback_choice_on_students'_revision_performance_learning_and_memory), and avoid them in the future.

A good example is my body language. Before COMM-101, I used little to no body language while communicating. However, for the presentation in the COMM-101 course, everyone told me to use more body language, which caused me to over-adjust. However, I did not know this was a problem until Dr. Rayed pointed it out. After identifying the issue, I can now take measures to adjust it accordingly.

### Competition

I respect Dr. Rayed for ensuring that there is no [comparison trap](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201711/the-comparison-trap) within the course. However, [more friendly competition may increase students' performance in the future](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228824732_Understanding_the_Relationship_Between_Critical_Thinking_and_Job_Performance). A prime example is the *Make Me Buy* task, where everyone was competing with each-other to make the best video!

However, outside university will not be as forgiving! While it is important to avoid students competing with eachother for grades like in KFUPM, it may be rewarding for students to be introduced to competition, in university, where there is little to no negative consequences.
