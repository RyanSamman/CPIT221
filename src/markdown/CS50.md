The biggest difficulty people have with programming is - **where do you start?**

Since our foundation year, I have been pushing my friends into doing Harvard's CS50, where I really started developing my programming and Computer Science skills.

**My goal was to make a video which would benifit the students, and bring them closer to their goals.** There have been several times since, where instead of explaining what CS50 was, I just sent my video on the course!

## Video Creation Process

First off, I needed to figure out how to use a camera, which took a suprisingly long amount of time! Apparently there was a ~well hidden~ button for recording video which I missed!

Then, I needed to record the actual video! The two person effect requires a lot of planning, so I needed to know exactly what I would be saying across the entire video, before even starting!

Afterwards, I recorded all night, until the sun started rising! In the end, I recorded **800 video clips** which I needed to tediously select the best clips out of.

For video editing, **I had no clue how to edit a video before this task.** Thankfully, Khaled helped me out, and showed me the basics of video editing with Vegas Studio. After a day of editing, I managed to edit it to how you see today... but at a higher resolution. For some reason, I have a bad habit of submitting the CPIT221 tasks late, and the *Make Me Buy* video was no exception! While the video finished rendering well before the deadline, YouTube apparently reached its peak traffic near the deadline, causing my video to take an extremely long time to upload. In the end, I gave up, and used a significantly lower resolution to get the video to upload in time.

For the Title and Thumbnail, it was a last second decision! While I was waiting for the video to upload, I was getting feedback from my friends on what the title should be, until I settled on **Learning to Program? Try Harvard's CS50!**. For the Thumbnail, a friend suggested adding something that looked hacker-like as a joke! As you can see from the final thumbnail, I took it seriously!

In the end, I felt like there was too little time for me to go in depth into CS50. I cut out several 'small' details, such as creating a Hash Table, from scratch, in C. I didn't want to scare people away from CS50 after all! However, I think this limitation is important, as the viewer's attention is limited in reality!
