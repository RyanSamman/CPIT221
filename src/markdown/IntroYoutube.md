<h1>Introductory YouTube Video</h1>
</center>


Our First task was to **create a YouTube video talking about ourselves for approximately two minutes!**

<div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;">
<iframe  style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uor4oVz-WJc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


I recorded my video exactly 127 times, and it took me nearly 4 hours to complete! From this task, I finally overcame my shyness, and became significantly better at speaking coherently.

In the background, [I was showing off a project I was currently working on](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_/status/1322913059539734529), to hopefully attract people who are interested in the stuff I was doing.

In the end of the video, **I mentioned three main goals** I wanted to accomplish by the end of this course.

### ✅ Motivate myself to posting Programming Content in new Mediums, such as Twitter and Youtube

Before the course, I always left projects unfinished when it got too hard, or took ages to complete them. However, since university, I now have an audience, and I feel obliged to always one up my previous project! Personally, every project I have done since university began has pushed me to the limits of my knowledge, including this website!

### ✅ Get closer to the University's Programming Community

On your own, it is hard to progress, and learn new things. Therefore, I want to meet others who I can learn from, get new perspectives, and spread my own knowledge to others. [If you want to learn or discuss programming, feel free to join me in my discord server!](https://discord.gg/vzMXPV6Xt3) For beginners, I put all the resources I've used over the past year to learn programming in one place. I even created the majority of this website live on discord, getting feedback from others along the way.

### ❌ The Final Goal - Creating a Blog 

In the beginning of the term, I felt like I wasn't skilled enough to create my own blog. However, using a website or template that hand-held the entire process isn't my style. I usually prefer creating things from scratch, rather than using libraries, which is why I prefer Computer Science. Therefore, I put it off for quite a while, until now!

Due to this task, I started uploading YouTube videos explaining concepts in the courses of FCIT, and I have nearly 100 hours of videos recorded!

The problem with the majority of the courses is that they do not go over why that concept was even created, and how to even use this knowledge! Therefore, I always go deeper into the why and how for nearly everything, and explain them to my friends to ensure I understood the concept at hand.

However, the majority of the videos were very low quality, and had horrible audio. For that reason, I have unlisted the videos, but I plan on making higher quality videos explaining concepts in the coming terms of FCIT!
