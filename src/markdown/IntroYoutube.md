<h1 id="first-task">Introductory Youtube Video</h1>
</center>


Our First task was to create a youtube video talking about ourselves for approximately two minutes!

I recorded my video exactly 127 times, and it took me nearly 4 hours to complete! From this task, I finally overcame my shyness, and became significantly better at speaking coherently.

In the background, [I was showing off a project I was currently working on](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_/status/1322913059539734529), to hopefully attract people who are interested in the stuff I was doing.

In the end of the video, **I mentioned three main goals** I wanted to accomplish by the end of this course.

### ✅ Motivate myself to posting Programming Content in new Mediums, such as Twitter and Youtube

Before the course, I always left projects unfinished when it got too hard, or took ages to complete them. However, since university, I now have an audience, and I feel obliged to always one up my previous project! Personally, every project I have done since university began has pushed me to the limits of my knowledge, including this website!

### ✅ Get closer to the University's Programming Community

On your own, it is hard to progress, and learn new things. Therefore, I want to meet others who I can learn from, get new perspectives, and spread my own knowledge to others. [If you want to learn or discuss programming, feel free to join me in my discord server!](https://discord.gg/vzMXPV6Xt3) For beginners, I put all the resources I've used over the past year to learn programming in one place. I even created the majority of this website live on discord, getting feedback from others along the way.

### ❌ The Final Goal - Creating a Blog 

In the beginning of the term, I felt like I wasn't skilled enough to create my own blog. However, using a website or template that hand-held the entire process isn't my style. I usually prefer creating things from scratch, rather than using libraries, which is why I prefer Computer Science. Therefore, I put it off for quite a while. 

**With this website, I originally just wanted to visualize the proposal grades.** A few hours in, I finally got used to the flow of React and Bootstrap, and I realized that this website could be much more than that! After a few days of work, I managed put together everything I needed for this website. Surpisingly, the majority of the codebase for this website can be translate directly into my blog, which I will start working on right as our exams finish!
