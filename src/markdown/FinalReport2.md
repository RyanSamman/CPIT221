I was using a [React library to create the charts](https://reaviz.io/), but I quickly realized that I could use this opportunity for something more!

However, **every project I have done with React has failed miserably in the past**. Even though, I decided to once again push my limits, and use this opportunity to have one more go at it!

A few days in, I figured that the website was good enough to show Dr. Rayed. Thankfully, he was on the same page as me, and gave me the permission to work on this website in place of my final report!

Learning from the mistakes of my past mistakes, **I decided to not worry about the design of my code and website**, and let the technical debt pile up! A badly designed project is better than an unfinished one.

After a few weeks of work, this is the finished product! While I initially thought I could kill two birds with one stone, and use the same codebase for my personal website and blog as well, [I decided against that for the reasons stated here.](https://github.com/RyanSamman/CPIT221)

If you couldn't tell from the visual design of this website, I still consider myself to be more of a backend person than a frontend person. However, I'm now confident I would be able to work effectively with people who are on the other end of the stack. I hope to be leading several projects in the near future, and a diverse range of knowledge is essential to be able to coordinate effectively!
