# LaTeX

Last summer, I met a Computer Science student from UNSW. At the time, he needed to write a lot of mathematical proofs, and used KaTeX. While he recommended me to learn it, the syntax looked extremely daunting, and I put it off for another time. 

While taking STAT210, I needed to write all those mathematical expressions while studying for the subject. Writing those equations took a significant amount of time, and it made studying the subject a pain.

However, with the final tasks of CPIT221, we were required to create our CVs in LaTeX. Not knowing how to begin, I decided to jump straight in the deep end, and try modifying a pre-existing template. While it caused my CV to be quite unoriginal, it was certainly better than what I would have created otherwise. However, I pushed myself to change as much as I could. After creating my CV, I attempted to summarize the final chapter of stat210, and it only took a few hours, instead of days! The result looked significantly more professional than my previous notes, and I'm sure I would be using this tool in the coming years of University.
