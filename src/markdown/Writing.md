<h1>Weekly Writing</h1>
</center>

I'm **Ryan Samman**, and I like visualizing data, 
such as [the Word Cloud I created earlier this term](https://github.com/RyanSamman/BlogWordCloud). 

After one of the tasks, the students were asked to write about their experience, working with strangers in a Group Task. Therefore, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to test out my programming skills, and scrape the data off Blackboard, and figure out the most common words mentioned in the writing.

My goal for the weekly writing was to develop my writing skills to be good enough to start a personal blog. Therefore, I decided to dedicate a good amount of time to preparing and writing each week!

## My process for Writing

### I start out by writing a bunch of points I want to talk about, which come naturally just by thinking deeply about the topic.

<details>

```
I think visual design has many practical applications.

UI Design, Websites, Games, GUIs, Fliers, Logos, CVs, creating documents/reports/slides

Extensive use cases

I think at least basic knowledge of Color Theory is an essential skill, and I'm glad I am taking it in University instead of figuring it out mid career

< Talk from Mit

Slides being supplementary rather than the primary source of information, I think Mr. ragid does this well.

I find myself looking at the professor and visualizing the slides, sorta like reading a book

If we extrapolate those ideas, we could have one set of slides for 'reading', after or before the lecture, and one set of slides for 'watching', with minimalized noise for maximizing visualization

I think for any person to be successful, they need to be able to market themselves and attract the people around them. Understanding visual design plays a key role in achieving that goal

In my opinion, an eye Visual Design is very important in our modern world. To be able to stand out amongst the crowd is no small feat, and Visual Design plays a key role in achieving that goal. The use cases of Visual Design are extensive, and include UI Design, Games, Logos, Reports, CVs, and more! I am thankful that I am learning about these concepts now, instead of trying to experiment and figure things out midway through my career.

I do think that there are flaws in the Power Point slides, however, does it really matter? The slides are just one small factor in our learning experience, and



I think how the slides are presented, is more important than the slides themselves
While it may seem harsh to be comparing the course to one from Harvard or MIT,
held to the same standards
While the criticism may seem heavy, being compared to courses from harvard and MIT reflects my opinion 
Just one factor where there are many at play

Bold ^ and down

The course slides are only one small factor in our learning experience, especially for a more skills-based course.

Personally, I think the slides are more supplementary source of information than a primary source of information. I find myself looking at the professor and visualizing the slides in my mind, like reading a book.

I think this lecture from MIT

 Personally, I tend to focus more on the professor and his words than the actual slides, visualizing what he is saying in my mind, similar to reading a book.

USES OF VISUAL DESIGN
An eye for Visual Design is very important in our modern world. 

To be able to stand out among the crowd is no small feat, and you need to be able to market yourself and attract the people around you. I think Visual Design plays a large role in creating a brand image for yourself or your company, as it's use cases are extensive. From Websites and Games to Logos and CVs, you can find Visual Design applicable everywhere.

SLIDES

Personally, I think the slides are a more supplementary source of information than a primary source of information. I find myself looking at the professor and visualizing the ideas in my mind, like reading a book, instead of focusing on the slides. 

From a novice's point of view, it may seem like the slides are great. However, I do think there are flaws.

### Then, I continously refine my main points, and remove any which are not relevant.

SLIDES

Speaking about Presentation Design reminded me of this talk from MIT on Public Speaking:

In the talk, the presenter spoke briefly about how slides should be structured to maximize the attention of the listeners. His main points were:

Minimize the design elements on the slides

After re-watching that talk from MIT, I decided to do a case study of an extremely successful online course, Harvard's CS50x.


https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/

If you take a look at the slides presented in the lectures, 

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KMzq3bLe7g_O4JVYZ0lxuxHjShnIk54beO84-chYTig/edit#slide=id.g62f05f0593_0_5238

you can see that they haven't just minimized the clutter, but have eliminated it entirely! The only thing on each slide is a visualization of the concept that the lecturer wants the students to be learning at that point in time.

In one of CPIT221's lectures, the professor mentioned that PowerPoint Slides are now a good way to create documents with good design. I think these days, people are confusing documents which are made for reading, and Slides which are made for presenting. When we load up the slides with a bunch of extra information, the audience's attention will be split between the presenter and the slides themselves.


Then I'll make the youtube video embedded

 Then I will put pics comparing CS50's slides to CPIT221's slides
 CS50's slides have nothing! Just a black background with boxes

SLIDES
While I was thinking about the course's slides, I remembered this talk from MIT on Public Speaking:

https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1449

In the talk, the presenter briefly spoke about how slides should be structured to maximize the attention of the audience. However, I was skeptical of the points mentioned at first. Therefore, I did a case study of a very popular Computer Science Course, Harvard's CS50x

https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/

I took a look at the slides of the course, and the results surprised me.


https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KMzq3bLe7g_O4JVYZ0lxuxHjShnIk54beO84-chYTig/edit#slide=id.g62f05f0593_0_5238

As you can see, there is absolutely no distractions whatsoever, the slides are very minimal and to the point. Each slide contains one bit of information at a time for the audience to slowly take in.

Compared to CPIT221's Slides:

From my quick research, I can summarize these points:
- The Slides should only be a secondary source of information, while the Presenter should be the primary source of information.
- The Slides shouldn't contain any unnecessary and distracting graphics

- Bigger font size and removing 


CONCLUSION
While I do think there should be a hard copy of the information students students need to know, I don't think the slides are the ideal place to put those details. 

However, there are serious drawbacks with what I have mentioned. In an ideal world, the professors would have enough time to dedicate to preparing their lecture materials. Sadly, we aren't in an ideal world, and our professors may have better things to do with their time. However, I do think that

### Finally, I link all the ideas together, and rewrite everything on Blackboard, for a finished weekly writing!
