<h1> What is Your Value? </h1>

In the end of CPIT221, we were asked to create a tweet, **emphasizing the values we bring to the table**, instead of the last two Weekly Writing tasks.

Of those who had skills, this was the perfect opportunity for students to get to know eachother better, [**and my post got nearly 6,000 views**!](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_/status/1329048742553661441)

However, the majority of students tended to lack a strong set of skills. That is perfectly fine! As freshman students of FCIT, the majority of us are still figuring out and developing our skills. 

Personally, the majority of my skills have only been a year in the making. However, with the right amount of effort and guidance, which I will go into detail in my blog, it is possible! In summary, you should simply find someone who has reached or is on the track to reach a goal similar to yours. The perfect way to find people like that is through searching through [#CPIT221_Value](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cpit221_value)!
Personally, this helped me discover some people who have interested me, and I am excited to work with them in the coming years! In fact, I have listed some of the people who have interested me below.
