In this task, **we were assigned to read through the IT summer training reports, and fix their mistakes!** 

This was the perfect opportunity to see what the skills the 3rd year IT students have built up over the years, and see the lessons and mistakes they have made. However, the majority of their reports were badly written, and that's where we came in! 

**The majority of the students weren't focusing on the grammar part of the course, *including me.*** It seems like it was not a coincidence that we needed to have comprehensive knowledge of the grammar taught to complete this task!

Originally, I thought that I would need to completely redesign the report, so I selected one and attempted to rebuild it from scratch! I found out that I understood the majority of the jargon, excluding some obscure mail servers, and was able to refactor their writing as well! However, halfway through, I realized what I needed to actually do, which was to find 10 mistakes and correct them.

To be honest, I believe that this is the weakest task in CPIT221. I didn't enjoy it that much, and it took an extremely long amount of time! However, it is a much more interactive way of realizing common grammar mistakes, rather than have CPIT221 go back to as it was only a year ago. 

I think this would have been a good opportunity to also show what the CS and IS students have been up to in their training as well, and allow students to form a better opinion on what they want to major in as well.
