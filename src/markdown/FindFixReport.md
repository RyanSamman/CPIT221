In one of the tasks, we were assigned to read through the summer students' job reports.

This allowed us to see what we may be facing in the future, and  learn from our senior's lessons and mistakes. However, the majority of their reports were badly written, and that's where we came in! While the majority of the students weren't focusing on the grammar part of the course, including me, we were required to find and correct their mistakes using the things we were taught.
