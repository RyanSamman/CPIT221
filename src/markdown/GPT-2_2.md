However, after putting together all the code needed, and scraping the text, I realized there was a major problem. The OCR library was not cleanly scraping the text from several images, due to issues with contrast and compression from twitter. After a long night of cleaning up the data with Regular Expressions, I managed to get a good amount of data. However, a lot of the text was unrecoverable and needed to be tossed.

Afterwards, I was thinking - What should I do with this data? Making another Word Cloud was getting boring, and I had just finished an Introductory Machine Learning course from [HPCC](https://twitter.com/KAUHPCC)! While doing the course, I was a bit disappointed that we were just using pre-written libraries to achieve a task. However, this made me realize that using AI and ML Libraries was not as hard as you might think, and after a day of intensive googling, I was able to train GPT-2 on the data I scraped.
