<center><h1>The End</h1></center>


In the start of the term, I was concerned that I would not be able to meet other people who share the same interests as me, due to Corona. However, thanks to CPIT221, **us students were able to form needed connections with each-other, even though we were not able to meet in person!** Through CPIT221, I have met [Khaled](https://twitter.com/KhaledMAlasmari), [Abdulrahman](https://twitter.com/Abdulr_ghazi), [Salman](https://twitter.com/rayed1420/status/1328838794854928389), [Waleed](https://twitter.com/er4ror), and many others! We are currently in the works of creating a small project together, and our hope is to get familiar with each-other's strengths and weaknesses. This, alongside the lessons I have learnt from the tasks, has had a significant impact in developing my professional skills.

What I like the most about CPIT221 is that **the majority of the learning is done on your own**! The only limitations to your growth in this course is your motivation and willingness to try out new things!

Dr. Rayed has definitely [used his previous research on how to use BlackBoard effectively](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1902/1902.00953.pdf), and our experience with blackboard in CPIT221 was significantly better than in other courses. Furthermore, the flexibility with the course times allowed us to enter when we liked, instead of dreading the next course.

Dr. Buhari and Dr. Rayed's stories were also much more effective than strictly following the slides, [as I mentioned here, when I reviewed the course's slides](/writing/visual-design). Overall, it has been the most engaging courses I have taken so far in King Abdulaziz University, and other courses may want to take a page out of CPIT221's book.

Thank you Dr. Rayed and Dr. Buhari for your support across this term! My hope is for this website to serve as an example for what students should strive for from the course, and go beyond just grades!

If you want to be up to date with my coming projects, [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Samman_)! While it may seem that I have been doing small random projects over the term, they will all be converging together relatively soon ðŸ˜‰!
