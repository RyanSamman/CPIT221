# Our Proposal

[We formed our team as I described in my weekly writing on Networking & Teams!](/writing/networking) Due to plans in the making since I've entered King Abdulaziz University, I had a large amount of people who I was interested in working with. 

However, I decided I wanted to try something new, and I decided to team up with people I've recently met in FCIT. While I don't like being in a leadership position, I was forced to, due to my ability to stay organized.
