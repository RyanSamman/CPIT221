[We formed our team as I described in my weekly writing on Networking & Teams!](/writing/networking) Due to plans in the making since I've entered King Abdulaziz University, I had a large amount of people who I was interested in working with. 

However, I decided I wanted to try something new, and I decided to team up with people I've recently met in FCIT. While I don't like being in a leadership position, I was forced to, due to my ability to stay organized. 

We started out researching all the points we wanted to cover, and added them incrementally to our trello board. We initally wanted to integrate CPIT201 and CPCS202 together, covering theoretical concepts in CPIT201, and applying them in practice in CPCS202. However, our strongest point would be teaching the students assembly! Therefore, we decided to scrap the idea, and focus entirely on CPCS202, and we created the presentation below.
