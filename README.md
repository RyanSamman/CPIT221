# My Experience with CPIT221

This website is dedicated to documenting my experience with the course. 

The website itself was created with React & Bootstrap. My goal for the website was initially to just display some data, however, I realized I could do much more than that, and this is the result!

My secondary goal was to experiment with creating a frontend without worrying about code structure, Design, or a backend. This allowed me to figure out what would be the best practices I should follow, which would have consumed a large amount of time on a normal project. Furthermore, I was able to research and experiment with several techniques to render Markdown. While this codebase is certainly not an example of good code structure & design, I have learnt a lot in the process of making this website, and I will be applying the lessons learnt in future projects.
